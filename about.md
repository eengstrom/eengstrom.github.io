> Wandering around the web is like living in a world in which every doorway is actually one of those science fiction devices which deposit you in a completely different part of the world when you walk through them. In fact, it isn’t like it, it is it.       ~ Douglas Adams

What is this oxymoronic "*Irregular Motif*", you are likely to ask... Well, it’s just a bunch of random thoughts, pretty much like any blog, and it's selfishly **all about me**. Yes, a self-serving, narcissistic blog, indexing the brain dump of my processing of my typical thoughts.  You see, my mind tends to wander at times, and the irregular and unrelated questions I pose myself won’t go away until I go figure out an answer to those questions. That’s the motif: irregular thoughts posed, with hopefully atypical and useful answers as a result.  I share my ramblings with the world, gleefully indexed by the Google-plex, and thereby augment my own memory.

Rather than dive into anything else **really** about me, I’ll just refer you to my other online presences:

(*NO Facebook* – I can’t stand Facebook.  Buy me a beer sometime and I’ll explain why ... and you can try to convince me I’m wrong, or at least hypocritical.)
